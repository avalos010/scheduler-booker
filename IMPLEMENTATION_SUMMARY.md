# Secure Booking Details - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

I've built a complete **secure booking details system** that allows users to access their booking information from email links without authentication, while preventing unauthorized access through unguessable tokens.

## üîí Security Solution

Instead of using predictable booking IDs like `/bookings/123` that anyone could guess, the system now uses **cryptographically random tokens**:

```
‚ùå INSECURE: https://yourapp.com/bookings/123
‚úÖ SECURE:   https://yourapp.com/booking/a7f9d3e2-8c4b-4a5e-9f1d-2b8c3d4e5f6a
```

Each booking gets a unique 128-bit UUID token that's impossible to guess.

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File**: `supabase-migrations.sql`

- ‚úÖ Added `access_token UUID` column to bookings table
- ‚úÖ Automatic token generation via `gen_random_uuid()`
- ‚úÖ Created index on `access_token` for fast lookups
- ‚úÖ Added RLS policy for public token-based access
- ‚úÖ Migration handles existing bookings automatically

### 2. Database Types

**File**: `src/lib/database.types.ts`

- ‚úÖ Added `access_token` field to booking types
- ‚úÖ Updated Insert/Update/Row types

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Updated Public Booking Creation

**File**: `src/app/api/bookings/public-create/route.ts`

- ‚úÖ Now returns `accessToken` in response
- ‚úÖ Returns full booking data with `.select().single()`

#### New Token-Based Booking Access API

**File**: `src/app/api/bookings/public-view/route.ts`

Three secure endpoints:

- ‚úÖ **GET** - View booking by token (no auth required)
- ‚úÖ **PATCH** - Update booking info by token
- ‚úÖ **DELETE** - Cancel booking by token

Features:

- Uses Supabase service role to bypass RLS
- Validates token before any operation
- Prevents updates to cancelled/completed bookings
- Formats times based on user preferences
- Updates time slot availability when cancelling

### 4. Frontend - Public Booking Details Page

**File**: `src/app/booking/[token]/page.tsx` (NEW)

Beautiful, responsive page with:

- ‚úÖ View booking details (date, time, client info, notes)
- ‚úÖ Edit contact information (name, email, phone, notes)
- ‚úÖ Cancel booking with confirmation modal
- ‚úÖ Status badges (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed)
- ‚úÖ Permission-based UI (can't edit completed bookings)
- ‚úÖ Loading states and error handling
- ‚úÖ Responsive design with modern UI

### 5. Frontend - Updated Booking Form

**File**: `src/components/bookings/PublicBookingForm.tsx`

Enhanced to show secure link after booking:

- ‚úÖ Displays booking link in green success banner
- ‚úÖ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ‚úÖ Clear instructions to save the link
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI with icons

### 6. Query Hook Updates

**File**: `src/lib/hooks/queries.ts`

- ‚úÖ Updated `createPublicBooking` return type to include `accessToken`
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript types for all responses

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase-migrations.sql`
4. Run the migration

The migration will:

- Add `access_token` column to bookings
- Generate tokens for existing bookings
- Create necessary indexes
- Set up RLS policies

### Step 2: Test the System

1. **Create a booking** through your public booking form
2. You'll see a **green success banner** with a secure link
3. **Copy the link** (it looks like `/booking/a7f9d3e2-8c4b-...`)
4. **Open the link** in a new incognito window (simulates email recipient)
5. **Verify** you can:
   - See booking details
   - Edit your information
   - Cancel the booking

### Step 3: Send Booking Links via Email

When you send confirmation emails, include the booking link:

```typescript
// Example: In your email sending code
const bookingLink = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/booking/${accessToken}`;

await sendEmail({
  to: booking.client_email,
  subject: "Booking Confirmation",
  body: `
    Your booking is confirmed!
    
    View your booking: ${bookingLink}
    
    Save this link to view or manage your booking anytime.
  `,
});
```

## üîê Security Features

### ‚úÖ What's Secure

1. **Unguessable Tokens**: 128-bit UUIDs are cryptographically random
2. **No Enumeration**: Can't iterate through bookings by changing IDs
3. **Single Booking Access**: Each token only works for one booking
4. **Automatic Generation**: Tokens created by database, not user input
5. **Fast Lookups**: Indexed for performance
6. **No Authentication Needed**: Convenient for clients

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Token Sharing**: Anyone with the link can access the booking

   - ‚úÖ This is by design (like Google Drive shareable links)
   - ‚úÖ Only send links to verified email addresses

2. **Email Security**: Protect against email compromise

   - ‚úÖ Use reputable email providers
   - ‚úÖ Consider encrypted email for sensitive bookings

3. **No Expiration**: Tokens are permanent
   - üí° Future enhancement: Add token expiration dates

## üìß Email Integration Example

Here's how to integrate with popular email services:

```typescript
// Using SendGrid
import sgMail from "@sendgrid/mail";

async function sendBookingConfirmation(booking: Booking, accessToken: string) {
  const bookingLink = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/booking/${accessToken}`;

  await sgMail.send({
    to: booking.client_email,
    from: "noreply@yourapp.com",
    subject: `Booking Confirmation - ${booking.date}`,
    html: `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
          <div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
            <h1 style="color: #4F46E5;">Your Booking is Confirmed!</h1>
            
            <p>Dear ${booking.client_name},</p>
            
            <div style="background: #F3F4F6; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
              <p><strong>Date:</strong> ${booking.date}</p>
              <p><strong>Time:</strong> ${booking.start_time} - ${
      booking.end_time
    }</p>
              ${
                booking.notes
                  ? `<p><strong>Notes:</strong> ${booking.notes}</p>`
                  : ""
              }
            </div>
            
            <a href="${bookingLink}" 
               style="display: inline-block; background: #4F46E5; color: white; 
                      padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; 
                      margin: 20px 0;">
              View Booking Details
            </a>
            
            <p style="color: #6B7280; font-size: 14px;">
              üí° Save this link to view or manage your booking anytime.
            </p>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>
    `,
  });
}
```

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can users guess other booking tokens?**  
A: No, tokens are 128-bit UUIDs with 5.3√ó10¬≥‚Å∂ possible combinations. Impossible to guess.

**Q: What if someone shares their booking link?**  
A: Anyone with the link can access that specific booking. This is intentional (like Google Drive links). Only send links to verified emails.

**Q: Can tokens expire?**  
A: Currently no, but you can add expiration as a future enhancement.

**Q: Do I need to change my existing bookings?**  
A: No, the migration automatically generates tokens for existing bookings.

**Q: What about authentication for business owners?**  
A: The existing authenticated routes (`/dashboard/bookings`) remain unchanged. This is only for client-facing booking access.

## üéâ Summary

You now have a **production-ready, secure booking details system** that:

- ‚úÖ Protects against unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Provides excellent user experience
- ‚úÖ Requires no authentication for clients
- ‚úÖ Follows security best practices
